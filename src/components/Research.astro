          This research project focuses on developing novel adaptive learning
          algorithms that can enable intelligent systems to learn and adapt in
          complex, dynamic environments. The goal is to create more robust and
          flexible AI systems that can handle uncertainty and changing
          conditions.

        Multimodal Perception for Autonomous Robots
      </h3>
      <p class="text-muted-foreground text-sm mb-2">
        Funded by the Department of Defense, 2020-2024
      </p>
      <div class="prose">
        <p>
          This research project investigates the use of multimodal perception,
          combining vision, audition, and other sensory modalities, to enable
          more robust and reliable perception for autonomous robots. The aim is
          to develop systems that can better understand and interact with their
          environments.
